Notes
======

Brain:

* rational decision maker
  - Visualize the picture
  - see the big picture
  - make long plan
* instinct gratification Monkey
  - easy and fun,
  - enjoy the moment and get immediate result
* Panic Moster
  - To frighten the monkey, and let rational decision maker control the wheel
  - pull all-nighter to meet the deadline.
  - No deadline -> no Panic Moster involve -> long term and hidden procrastination.



> - What is inside the mind of procrastinator?
> - Why do we procrastinate? 
> - How should we stop procrastinating?

For procrastinators, There is a **instinct gratification monkey** in their brain who always trying to take control the wheel of their behavir so that they can do something which is easy and fun instead of hard and board.

He mentioned that A deadline can trigger the panic monster to reduce the effect of procrastination.

However, there is another hidden procrastination when there is no deadline. such as losing weight, fix a relationship, .. etc.
He introduced the "Life calander" which is a box for every week of a 90-year life. He thought we need to take some time to fill the calander and thought how much time left for us to chasing our dream.


From my perspective,
- sometime the Monkey can beat the Monster if there is no punishment or rewards on the deadline.
- Try to revise the "Want to do" list to "Have to do" list.
- Don't do it alone. Find a partner who have same dream and you can work it on together
