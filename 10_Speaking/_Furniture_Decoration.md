Notes
=====

Accommodation:
- Tiny <--> Spacious

Furniture I have/like/hate:

- My parents give me a `antique vase` as the gift on the `housewarming party`
- I bought a `carpet` with zebra print and the fabric has a very `soft texture`.
- Most of my furniture `is made out of` woods/glasses.

> Notice: Furniture is uncountalbe. No ~~Furnitures~~

Future buy:

- It is widely believed that `tumble dryer`, `robotic vacuum cleaner` and `dish washer` can help people save marriage from divorce
- Smart `household appliances`, such as google assistant and smart light bulb.


Home Decoration:

- Previous/like/hate: `warm tone` -> `floral curtain`, `flower-patterned curtain`
- Redecorate
  - Light curtains **brighten up** a wall and a light ceiling can brighten up an entire room
  - Paint the wall with light and **neutral** colors.
  - hang paintings and photographs
- Why not Renovate/Redecoratwe?
  - `unfit for human habitation`
  - limited budget

Decoration Style:

- `Minimalism`: 
  - Minimalism is all about living with less. **minimalists** usually **get rid of excess stuff** and living life based on experiences rather than worldly possessions
  - The `interior design` is simple, but very pleasant to look at.


- Modern:
  - Furniture pieces were no longer made exclusively out of wood.
  - I prefer Modern style because traditional style needs too much of `interior` items *which* `contradicts` to me **being** a minimalist.
- Traditional:
  - dark woods, `elegant wallpaper`, `patterned rugs` and `intricate detail`.

- Back to 1980:
  - Poster of Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson
  - Antique JukeBox play songs from 1980 to 1990
  - `Every nook and cranny` of the bar was filled with artcrafts made at the period
  - American country style
