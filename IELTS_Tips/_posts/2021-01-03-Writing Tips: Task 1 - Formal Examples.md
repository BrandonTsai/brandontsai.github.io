> - Suggestions for improvement



Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is James Stone, a frequent customer at your restaurant. **I am writing to express my satisfaction with** the services you give and recommend few things that could be introduced to take your organisation to the next level.

I must say, I always enjoy each and all your cuisines I have tried out, they all tasted well cooked and delicious. The food that particularly stand out for me is the special local menu Pounded yam and Egusi soup, I have come back for the same food weekly for three months in a row.

Also, I love the ambient, site and the view from the restaurant. Being suited on the harbour close to the beach makes it a prefect spot for relaxation especially with the busy life schedules in Lagos.  

Recently, I observed the customer service is dropping. This may be as a result of the increased patronage from people from far and new. I would suggest to enrol your staff for a customer service training or workshop so they can appreciate the value of customers and the need to treat us as kings and queens.

**I hope you will consider my suggestion favourably.**

Yours faithfully,
Chris Omon

from an exam. You were ill that day, but failed to submit the evidence. Write a letter to the  
Examinations Committee explaining your situation. You should include:  
– Apologies for the situation  
– Identification for yourself (Name, Student Number, Case Number)  
– An explanation of what had happened and any possible evidence you may have  
– Possible resolutions to consider.


To the University of Albion examinations committee,

**I am writing in response to your letter regarding** my unauthorised absence from the mathematics examination held on the 24th September, case number M2342.

My name is Deborah Meaden (student number A345), and `I would first like to sincerely apologise for` failing to properly notify the university of my inability to attend the examination last Tuesday.

`Unfortunately`, I awoke in hospital on the morning of the examination, and was informed that I had been found unconscious, lying on the pavement by the bus stop. A member of the public had called an ambulance and I was admitted to the local general hospital, where I regained consciousness several hours later. As I was required to remain in hospital for several days, I was unable to make contact with the university, but I have included my medical certificates as evidence for my claim.

`To rectify this issue`, I would like to request that the committee permit me to take the examination on another date, or to substitute the grade for an average taken from my previous work, lest I fail the entire module.

**My apologies once again, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.**

Yours faithfully,  
Deborah Meaden

Dear Sir or Madam,

**I am writing this letter to express my desire to** volunteer as an English teacher in any one of the developing countries. 


I had a Masters degree in the English language and I have been working as a senior English teacher at a public school for eight years.

As you know, the summer vacations are drawing closer and I am planning to spend those two months in a developing nation teaching English to poor and destitute children. I have always wanted to volunteer but never got an opportunity.

After seeing your advertisement I searched online about your programs and I have decided that I want to volunteer in an African country. Let me know if you have any openings there. If that is not possible, you can send me to any other country. I am available from the start of May until the end of June.

**Thank you for your time and consideration.**

**I look forward to hearing from you.**

Yours faithfully,

Brandon

Dear Mr. Smith,

``I am writing this letter to inform you of`` my decision to resign from the post of Sr Project Manager of your **esteemed** organization ``so that`` I can **pursue** my career in the upcoming field of machine learning.

During my **tenure** as senior programmer, ``I have grown both`` **``responsibly``** ``and professionally``. While, I had no **intentions** of switching to another field until recently I **came across** a job opening at Google for machine learning and decided to apply for it. After 8 rounds of interview I got selected and as the job was at Google and in an upcoming field of technology, I decided to take it.

``It was an extremely difficult decision to make as I have been associated with your company for more than 5 years now``. This place molded / carved me into the accomplished professional that I am today. Over the last 5 years I have learnt a lot of things like budgeting and planning, recruitment and account management. When I joined the organization back in 2014, we were only 20 employees and now in 2019 we are a team of 200 employees and counting.

I wanted a small favor from you. I will require a letter of reference from you which I need to furnish at the time of joining the new workplace. The letter should state my behavior and make a brief mention of my achievements.

``Thank you for your support`` **``throughout``** ``the years and wishing the company best of luck for its future`` **``endeavors``**.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sir or Madam,

**I am writing this letter to enquire about the arrangements for** my stay with my family at your hotel. I have recently been through your website and I must admit that while checking out the photos I was really impressed with the sea view from the rooms.

I am planning a weekend getaway with my wife and our 3 year old daughter from 25th  Dec to 26th  Dec. I am really looking forward to a room a sea facing room. Please give me information about the facilities / activities that will keep us occupied during our stay. Your website states that you have a spa, meditation room and cake mixing sessions for adults, and a baby gym and pool for children.

I would also like to know how much a weekend stay would cost with all the activities included. Also though we are coming for a short period, we would like to go around. So kindly suggest some interesting tourist places around.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Topic: Reject Offer
--------------

> You cannot go to a company where you got an offer. Write a letter to the HR supervisor to**
	-   explain the reason why you decline the offer
	-   express you gratitude
	-   explain you like your current job very much

Dear Sir or Madam,  
  
I was a potential employee to whom you made a job offer. I would like to extend my thanks for such an offer, especially at such a company as yours. It is, however, with deepest regret that I must decline your generous invitation and apologize for any inconvenience I may have caused.  
  
I appreciate immensely the interview organized by your company and the extensive effort made by all the staff involved. Their attitude was impressive and highly commendable. As such I must pass my sincerest apologies for any difficulties related to the extra work that must have been involved, and the time wasted on your behalf. Although the offer was substantial, it wasn’t enough to encourage me to sever the bonds with my current employer. During my time at my present company my superiors supported me and fostered my career. In short, they made me the employee I am today.  
  
I would like to keep the lines of communication open between our two parties, and look forward to further correspondence.  
  
Yours faithfully,

Brandon
