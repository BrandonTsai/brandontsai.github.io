Dear Neha,  
  
How are you? I hope you are healthy and happy. What about the result of your M.B.A course? I am glad to tell you that I have got a **distinction** in my M.Sc. course and `would like you to be present at a party I am` **`throwing`** `to` **`commemorate`** `the event` on 25th August.  
  
I am planning for a small party at my home this coming Sunday, 25th August. I would like to **invite** you to the **commemoration** and I really want to see you on that day. I have invited all our childhood friends, hence it would be a get-together party for all of us. This party will definitely be a good reason to meet.  
  
Last year I moved into a new apartment which is in **Satellite** area of the city and I hope you have my address. It is very easy to find my residence. First, you should reach the Satellite area, main road and towards the left of the entrance, you will find a shopping mall called KH 24; from there you should come straight away and you will find my apartment. I have sent you my **coordinates** at Google Maps in your email.  
  
However, if you have any difficulty in finding my address, just call me. I will send my **cousin** for your help. 

`See you at the party then.`
  
Best wishes,  
  
Rahul

>A friend, who lives in another country, has invited to you come and stay with him/her on your next holiday. You are too busy to accept the invitation. Write a letter to your friend. In your letter: 
     –  thank him/her for the invitation 
     –  explain why you cannot come 
     –  give him/her your other news

Dear Peter,

`I hope you are well and the reason I am writing is to respond to your kind offer.`

`Let me start by expressing my gratitude for the offer` to stay with you over the Easter holidays. `It was also very kind of you` and saying you would pick me up from the airport was really appreciated. I miss you so much so `it is with deep regret that I cannot come` this year.

`As to the reason I am unable to` visit you, which is because I promised my sister I will stay in town and help her renovate her house. She just bought it last month and she wants me to paint the walls and replace the carpet and I made the promise before your kind offer.

I also want to let you know that Steven got promoted to Sales Manager. My even bigger news is that Steven and I are going to get married in March. I hope you can come here and join us for this special occasion.

Please let me know if you can come at your earliest convenience.

Best wishes,

Sarah

Apology

- I want to express from the depths of my heart how sorry I am to...

> Write a letter to a friend. You have borrowed something from your friend and it got damaged.
	- Apologize for damaging the product
	- Explain what happened
	- Say how are you going to fix the issue
 
Dear Emily,

  

Sorry it’s taken me so long to write to you but at last I put pen to paper to explain why I haven’t returned that DIY book I borrowed from you.

To be honest, I’ve been **feeling so guilty** that I delayed writing to you. I have to own up that I damaged the book accidentally. I’m so very sorry. I know how important that book is to you as it was passed down from your late father.

  
`What happened is that` I had been reading up on the chapter about DIY plumbing when I knocked over my cup of coffee which splashed all over the book. Most of the stain is on the pages that were open at the time.

I’ve sent the book away to be repaired. I didn’t realise that was even possible until I researched it. Anyway, it should be as good as new when I get it back next week and then I’ll send it on to you.

`Again, I’m so sorry for the delay in telling you. I hope you can forgive me.`

Best wishes

Sarah
